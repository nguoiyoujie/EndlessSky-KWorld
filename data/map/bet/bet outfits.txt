The smallest forward engine available to the public is sized beyond the limits of a fighter or interceptors. Apart from that, this thruster boasts better thrust-space efficiencies than what Bet's neighbors can offer.`

A star map can be the difference between reaching home or being stranded without fuel. The star map is also marked with essential information such as: notable planets, ports, governments, trades and services, for those who wish to save the effort of making a personal survey themselves."
