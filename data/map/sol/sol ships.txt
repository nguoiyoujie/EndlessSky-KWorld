	description `The first interspace vessels fielded by the Organization were decendants of their ubiquitous Vertical Take-Off and Landing Improvised Aero-Space (VTOLIAS) design. The Firefly-class, and the Shuttle, are the pioneer members of the first-generation Vertical-Take-Off and Landing Intra-Space (VTOLIS) vessels. In particular, the Firefly sports the earliest of Sol armaments designed for exfoilating asteroid matter for extraction. Thus began the space mining economy for the species.`
