	description `The Atlotl Catapult series is amongst the more primitive of Sentient Machine's weapons, intended for mining outfits with access to workshops that can work raw metals into armaments. The iron variant utilizes sharp iron bolts intended to dent and puncture the hull. While not strong enough to cause damage, the magnetic properties of the bolts can interfere with shield function.`

	description `The Atlotl Catapult series is amongst the more primitive of Sentient Machine's weapons, intended for mining outfits with access to workshops that can work raw metals into armaments. The carbide variant is, curiously, wholly compatible with the tungsten-carbide kinetic rod. The Atoltl heats and launches these rods almost at the point of disintegration, sacrificing range for kinetic impact.`
	description `	Beware that because the material had been pushed to its limits, shields can disintegrate such rods easily, limiting this variant to a mostly anti-hull role.`

	description `The Atlotl Catapult series is amongst the more primitive of Sentient Machine's weapons, intended for mining outfits with access to workshops that can work raw metals into armaments. The uranium variant is the heaviest variant, on account of handling one of the densest materials in space. The Atoltl heats and launches these rods almost at the point of disintegration, sacrificing range for kinetic impact.`
	description `	Most space-worthy hulls are resistant to radiation effects. However, uneven radiation incidence has been proven to disrupt shield integrity to the point of discharging them until the ship manages to remove such material from its hull. Should the hull be punctured, these materials may also affect electronics.`
