	description "Highly laminated membrane fuel cells are relatively simple to make and can host a wide variety of reactants, allowing it to be installed in small vessels that cannot afford more complex operations. Technically, fuel used for power generation is not a infinite resource, so this is truly a glorified battery, but let's not question the specifications."

	description "The TR-1650R, but backwards. There may be some case where a ship is too bulky, or its side steering too insufficient, to turn around in a timely manner. As such, a thruster in the opposite direction can be used to slow the ship."
	description "	Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section. Additionally, since weapon ports were not designed to hold an engine, some adjustments had to be made and the supports would take a small premium on weapon space."

	description "The idea of cooling by sacrificing the very limited matter on board is at best outrageous, but Codex Corporation claims to have found a solution. With the use of ramscoop, the Ablator achieves a balance between incoming and outgoing materials, compressing incoming fuel to power a thermal exchanger and collect acculmulated heat before ejection into space. The Ablator may also be configured to point its nozzles in the direction of thrust, allowing for a little boost from the heat of the main engines."

	description `In space, where a ships' standard radiative coating offers innate defenses against energy-based weapons, kinetic weapons promise a nasty punch to where it hurts most. The Kinetic Rod is as simple as it is effective: Slugs of tungsten-carbide slamming against delicate hull plates, crushing electronics and cracking outfit cavities. The brutality of this way of combat is a testament to humanity's prior experience in warfare, as primitive as they are.`
	description `	Shields can often blunt the impact of the Kinetic Rod by electromagetic induction, forcing incoming rods to deviate from their trajectory and scrape the hulls at an angle. Nevertheless, Kinetic Rods are capable of inflicting damage through their sheer weight and energy.`
