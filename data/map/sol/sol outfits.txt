	description "	Because a reverse thruster must be facing forwards, it must be installed in the weapon section of your ship instead of the engine section. Additionally, since weapon ports were not designed to hold an engine, some adjustments had to be made and the supports would take a small premium on weapon space."

	description "It is quite a mystery how the discovery came to be, but the recent times saw quite a few breakthroughs to the topic of manipulating time. To the uninitiated, it takes a lot of energy to divert the passage of time, and it is impossible to send matter to the past. However, methods to slow time to a crawl had been achieved. The drive works on the basis of 'slowing' the sense of time during interspace travel, returning to normalcy after a determined set time. During travel, fuel is consumed at a rate depending on the mass of the ship being moved, and these too factor into the trajectory of the ship. As such, navigational computers are calibrated very carefully to ensure safe arrival within proximity to the target star. For this reason, early human exploration are limited to very bright stars."
	description "	Despite advancements in this technology, the rate of ships spontaneously crumbling in chronospace travel due to human error, mechanical fault or interference from a celestial body remains high. This is a lottery you hope to avoid."

With the use of ramscoop, the Ablator achieves a balance between incoming and outgoing materials, compressing incoming fuel to power a thermal exchanger and collect acculmulated heat before ejection into space. The Ablator may also be configured to point its nozzles in the direction of thrust, allowing for a little boost from the heat of the main engines."
