	description `The basic workforce of the Sentient Machine's economic fleet, the Worker Bee is light and carries the bare minimum needed to perform its role - gathering resources for its brethren on the planet or moon it hails from. You wonder if the Bees themselves are sentient, but it seems too risky to test your curiousity.`

	description `The Mason variant of the Bee is a rarity; they are movers of material and are assigned the role of construction. That doesn't exempt them from some space duty, and some were assigned as a glorified cargo bot. You wonder if the Bees themselves are sentient, but it seems too risky to test your curiousity.`
