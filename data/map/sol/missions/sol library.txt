			``
			`	The Gaia System is conceptualized and designed by System Phi. It is a modular material and lifeform analysis suite implanted deep within the planet's crust, sometimes embedding it within the mantle. It's primary task is to monitor the status of the planet as well as the inhabitants within. In some of the later variants, the Gaia System has some capacity to influence planetary attributes and shape the world into a more hospitable place to live in.`
			`	It is said that some Gaia Systems are capable of remote influence, allowing the system to persuade some residents to perform actions not initiated by themselves. The ethics of this development is still in question, and in the interim, such uses are restricted and allowed only with permission of the residing World Controller.`

			`	In 2021, the First Ascendant, Her Ladyship Kasouchinou Namiko, directed the Council of World Systems to form a network of Archives, following the limited success of Knowledge Archives that was established in Sol. Such Archives would compile information about the System, its culture, its history, its government, and its deals with the central government. The records would be available to view as public record for the residents and members of the Common Forum, the inter-galactic plebian committee.`
			`	It is hoped that with this initiative would lower the boundaries between Systems and foster greater cooperation in technology and culture. The Common Forum has celebrated the initiative. However, not all System governments are happy with the path taken toward this objective.`
