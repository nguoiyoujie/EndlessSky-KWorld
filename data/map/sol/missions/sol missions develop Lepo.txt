############### MISSIONS: LEPO ###############
#	Lepo is an outpost on Arneb, 4 jumps from Sol. With 3 jumps, you can stop at Tiptoe/Rigel along the way.
#	It is advanced enough to have some workshop and an outfitter, it is severely understaffed
#	It starts to show when packages meant for Earth were sent to Io instead.
#
#	Intent:
#		'Tutorial' for longer ranged hyperspace travel, showing the importance of having sufficient fuel and fuel conservation to reach Arneb.
#
#
#	Lepo questline should be allowed to be skipped without major repercussions

			`A hulk of a machine approaches you.

			`The android calls you over. You were not aware that a machine is capable of cursing, but the grating sounds are fresh as you walk over. The words were not directed to you, however, as the android shoos its assistant away as you stand next to it.`
