	description `	The human species have recently entered an era of 'information technology' and is getting into grips with the notion of travelling within intra-space - a term representing the space within a star's influence up to its magnetosphere. Fortunately, this venture is not old, and visitors have came and shaped humanity to its current height with an invisible hand. Unfortunately, this hand wishes to remain invisible.`
	description `	Yekaterinburg, also known at some point as the second capital of Russia, is home to an underground megacity extending from the rocks of the Ural to the surface of the mantle. It is relatively young, having started construction in 1942 leeching off the policies from the Soviet Union, and opened for service and residence in 1955. Its early years was formative with the introduction of the first AI supercomputer 'C-CUBE' as its President and city manager, which expanded the city to its present heights and depths today.`

They are operated by a group known as the 'Organization', a 5-million underground nation living to the whims of a selective upper-class known as the 'Establishment'. The elders used to be known as 'the Committees', but had taken this new name as if to spite a certain group of 'fickle populists'.

	description "When human explorers first used Chronodrives, the brightest stars of the night sky were their first targets, not only because they could ride on the historical fame of the star, but also because navigation relied on the identifying stars relative to their immediate surroundings. It is bad for a captain to gun his ship towards a speck of light and miss by 100x his anticipated distance, and gravity wells can only be sensed at close-range. Therefore, most starlanes from Sol led to especially hot and luminous systems."
