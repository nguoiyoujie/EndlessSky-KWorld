############### GENERIC INTERSYSTEM JOBS ###############
# Note: Generic jobs should have a destination at least one jump away. For intrasystem jobs, define them individually
# allow to show on non-visited, 'disclosing' undiscovered outposts

### ASTEROID MINING ###
# Because asteroid mining requires specialized tools and a conscious effort to harvest them, offer at least +50% margin.
# The size of requested materials should be based on payout
#	50k-100k
#	100k-250k for large
# For precious metals (silver, gold, platinum), increase scale to
#	100k-200k
#	200k-500k for large
# Unfortunately, Endless Sky lack substitution logic for outfit and numeric amounts, so several copies may need to be hand-copied
