	description "It is a dream that a ship captain can traverse several metropolitan systems in a row. Until then, space travel in the wild is not for the navigationally-challenged. A star map can be the difference between reaching home or being stranded without fuel. The star map is also marked with essential information such as: notable planets, ports, governments, trades and services, for those who wish to save the effort of making a personal survey themselves."
