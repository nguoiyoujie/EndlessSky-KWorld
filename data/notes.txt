## Naming Conventions
#	As far as possible, use prefix 'KW.' in front of internal names to distinguish items from vanilla ES (and other plugins)
#
## System Names
#		KW.<region_code>.<system_index>.<name>
#			<region_code>
#				Region code for a sector in space. Ideally, use 1-2 characters. For regions alloted to major factions, use their initials.
#				Try to limit each region to less than 40 systems. We don't need that many.
#			<system_index>
#				A numeric index representing each system within a region.
#				[KW.<region_code>.<system_index>] should uniquely identify a world.
#				The capital homeworld / most notable world should be numbered 000.
#				For faction regions, major worlds, which are named after the faction, should be next in order.
#				Placement of remaining worlds is not important, only that the index is unique.
#			<name>
#				The display name of the world. This allows for easier reference and search, and recovery in case the editor erases this information.
#
## Planet Names
#		KW.<region_code>.<system_index>.<planet_index>.<name>
#			<region_code> <system_index>
#				Identical to the system it is in.
#			<planet_index>
#				A numeric index representing each world within a system.
#				Placement of planets is not important, only that the index is unique.
#
## Wormhole Names
#		KW.WH.<name>
#			WH represents 'Wormhole'
#			<name>
#				The intuitive name for the wormhole path
#

#

#	System Scope Planning:
#
#	Thoughtform
#		Godlike 'Species?'
#		The thoughtform is felt and known by many names, but never adequately described.
#		The most agreeable description is that they are 'Automata of the Gods', scripts of the Greater World with their limits turned into personalities.
#		The true capabilities of a Thoughtform is not known. What is known, is that they may possess other living beings to act as their surrogates.
#			The Creator and Destroyer positions are held exclusively by such beings.
#			In the space of this plugin, three of them are known in flesh, and others may be felt.
#			The main method of interference is to hijack meta elements of the game (one of the Thoughtforms handles story narration and questlines - this is invisible to the player until such Thoughtform is angered enough to disrupt gameplay). Meta-element manipulation work by modifying the player's 'perception' of his abilities via outfit/planet/system changes. For example, the Narrator may 'remove' hyperlanes to force the player towards a system.
#			It is generally not intended for the player to face any one of them as an opponent.
#
#	Sanctuary
#		Highly-Advanced Mix
#		Leader, Imperial Guards Fleet
#		Includes all populations and species from the Council of World Systems (19 worlds)
#			Generally, they do not produce special outfits of their own.
#				However, they could 'combine' some outfits for a slightly more efficient design.
#			Ships are vastly mix-tech, and intended to be competitive with the 'metagame' and top-of-the-line builds.
#
#	Alph
#		Highly-Advanced Species
#		Leader, First Fleet
#		Rooted space plants, a mix of biological and lithic construction, largely non-mobile
#			Notable invention: Integument - arms of the civilization to breach space and distance restrictions and reach other spaces.
#			Major vessels are either very slow and colossal, or use the Integument space-warping portals to become highly mobile at the price of fragility.
#			Minor vessels are essentially an Integument portal with weapons or cargo ports inside its 'bag of holding' - Very high outfit spaces, but very fragile. Think drone warfare, but with portals.
#			Main method of travel - Integumental Xylem / Phloem nodes (moon-sized Integument surfaces for wormhole-like portals), Integument Jump Drives (jump drives with heavy defensive malus)
#
#	Bet
#		Highly-Advanced Species
#		Leader, Second Fleet
#		Biological nurturers, obsessed with genetics and fertility, the most populous system by count of independent thinkers.
#			All Bet outfits feature bunks. Even if you don't want them to.
#			Major vessels are like mini homeworlds, populous to the extent that one outfitted ship may have 2-3x the bunks of a similarly sized ship. This comes at a Maintainence Cost on top of necessary crew costs, however.
#			Minor vessels are also larger than equivalent hull classes of other ships.
#			Main method of travel - Edrin's Chronodrives
#
#	Canc
#		Highly-Advanced Species
#		Leader, Fourth Fleet
#			WIP
#
#	Det
#		Highly-Advanced Species
#		Leader, Fifth Fleet
#		Bio-ethereal communicators, introspective and full of faith and exploration to 'other worlds'. Suspected an offshoot descendant of the Thoughtform, though no one could prove it.
#			The homeworlds are actually hosts of members of other species, having fallen in battle, in illness or of old age. Rituals are performed to prepare them for the afterlife.
#			The keyword of Det's military is 'Sudden Death Syndrome'. If possible, weapons work on debilitating conditions, slow, corrosion, etc. to a larger degree than Canc.
#			Main method of travel - Edrin's Chronodrives
#
#	Dgt
#		Advanced Species
#		Lithic robots, who are content dwelling in rocks, because they are rich not in real space, but in digital space
#			(If possible, implement some kind of healing of friendly ships??)
#			Weapons are generally 'hacking' type, which are instant-hit weapons that apply ion
#			Main method of travel - Edrin's Chronodrives
#
#	Edrin
#		Advanced Species
#		Bio-mechanical titans, mastreos of chronomancy
#			Temporal manipulation is powerful but limited. Essentially you can slow, (almost pause), and fast forward, but it takes immense energy to send information to the past (sending matter in a coherent manner is not possible, let alone sustaining life)
#			Invented the Chronodrive. Their ships use the most efficient drive systems (jump-fuel ratio), but with no jump drive capability
#			Vessels generally use 'instant-hit' weapons, with a focus on 'slowing' the enemy.
#			Main method of travel - Chronodrives
#
#	Xil
#		Advanced Species
#		Biological thinkers and tinkerers, sufficiently advanced to practice ~*magic*~
#			Vessels are classed into different 'specializations'
#				Magister Elementalis uses 'primary elements' to break their enemies
#					Elementalis Furia - Fire (heat)
#					Elementalis Ees - Ice (anti-energy / anti-shield)
#					Elementalis Fluva - Wind (high knockback)
#					Elementalis Euf - Earth (anti-hull kinetic weapons)
#				Magister Travis (Motion) manipulates motion with tractor beams, grabbers and banishers.
#				Magister Tempus (Time) uses primarily Edrin weapons - instant hit and slow.
#				Magister Automata (Agency) is perhaps the most dangerous - uses a minefield of 'Automata' organisms that behave like corrupting nanobot/gel.
#				Magister Idelis (Thought) is (hopefully) not an opponent.
#
#	Ker
#
#
#	Mid
#
#
#	Nat
#		Moderate Species
#		Parasitic organisms, donning the masks of the creature it controls. Also known as the 'body-snatchers'
#
#			Nat has a natural symbiotic enemity with Fel, as it currently derives most of its host bodies from the feralistic jungle of Fel and Fel-aligned communities.
