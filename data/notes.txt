## Naming Conventions
#	As far as possible, use prefix 'KW.' in front of internal names to distinguish items from vanilla ES (and other plugins)
#
## System Names
#		KW.<region_code>.<system_index>.<name>
#			<region_code>
#				Region code for a sector in space. Ideally, use 1-2 characters. For regions alloted to major factions, use their initials.
#				Try to limit each region to less than 40 systems. We don't need that many.
#			<system_index>
#				A numeric index representing each system within a region.
#				[KW.<region_code>.<system_index>] should uniquely identify a world.
#				The capital homeworld / most notable world should be numbered 000.
#				For faction regions, major worlds, which are named after the faction, should be next in order.
#				Placement of remaining worlds is not important, only that the index is unique.
#			<name>
#				The display name of the world. This allows for easier reference and search, and recovery in case the editor erases this information.
#
## Planet Names
#		KW.<region_code>.<system_index>.<planet_index>.<name>
#			<region_code> <system_index>
#				Identical to the system it is in.
#			<planet_index>
#				A numeric index representing each world within a system.
#				Placement of planets is not important, only that the index is unique.
#
## Wormhole Names
#		KW.WH.<name>
#			WH represents 'Wormhole'
#			<name>
#				The intuitive name for the wormhole path
#
